Pthread function is used to create three threads.
Each thread utilises pthread three times.
To set the scheduling parameters for the threads pthread setschedparam function is used to set the scheduling parameters for the threads.
Join the threads and use pthread setschedprio()  to mark the clock for the default priority result.
All the timings are added in "Output.txt" file.
The file readings are then used to create hitograms.
